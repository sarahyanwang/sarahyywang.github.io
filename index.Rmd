# This is Yan's personal website

I'm current a first year MS student in Biostatistics in CUMC. Here is my personal website with some of my past academic experiences, look it up if you are interested.

Also, there is a dashboard page that I made several plots from the NOAA National Climatic Data.

Here is a picture of myself.
